# Author MCP App

## Overview

This skill guides users through building Python MCP servers and
web APIs that are self-contained, deployable apps. Solutions built
with this guidance work locally (stdio, single user) and deployed
(HTTP, multi-user) without code changes.

## Framework Choice

This skill supports two approaches:

### Recommended: mcp-app (config-driven)

[mcp-app](https://github.com/echomodel/mcp-app) is a framework that
wraps FastMCP and Starlette. You define tools as plain async functions,
wire up with two lines in Python, and run with one command. No config
files, no framework imports in your tool code.

**What the user gets with mcp-app:**

- **Zero framework code in tools.** Tools are plain async functions.
  No decorators, no FastMCP imports, no framework coupling in
  business code. mcp-app discovers public async functions from the
  module declared in `tools:` and registers them automatically —
  function names become tool names, docstrings become descriptions,
  type hints become schemas.

- **User identity and profile.** Identity middleware runs by default
  in HTTP mode — validates JWTs, loads the full user record (auth +
  profile) in one store read, sets `current_user` ContextVar. The
  SDK reads `current_user.get()` for user identity and profile data.

- **User management out of the box.** REST admin endpoints
  (`POST /admin/users`, `GET /admin/users`,
  `DELETE /admin/users/{email}`, `POST /admin/tokens`) — user
  registration with optional profile data, listing, revocation,
  and token issuance with no code.

- **Per-user data storage.** `filesystem` store (default) provides
  per-user JSON under XDG-compliant paths. Custom stores plug in
  via module path. The SDK accesses data through `get_store()`.

- **Typed profile with Pydantic.** Apps declare a profile model
  on the `App` object. Profile data is validated at registration
  and hydrated as a typed object on `current_user.get().profile`.

- **One composition root.** The `App` class declares name, tools
  module, profile model, and store in one place. CLIs (`serve`,
  `stdio`, `connect`, `users`, `health`) are derived automatically.
  The admin CLI generates typed flags from the profile model.

- **Free tests for auth, admin, and wiring.** `mcp_app.testing`
  ships test modules that check auth enforcement, user admin, JWT
  handling, CLI wiring, and tool protocol compliance against your
  app. Import them, provide your `App` as a fixture, get 25+ tests.

- **Identity enforced by default.** Every tool is wrapped with
  identity enforcement — if no user is established (HTTP middleware
  didn't run, stdio `--user` wasn't passed), the tool returns an
  error instead of running unauthenticated. You can't accidentally
  ship a wide-open service.

- **Deployable anywhere.** Standard container image, any platform.
  Or use [gapp](https://github.com/echomodel/gapp) for rapid
  deployment to serverless Cloud Run.

**Install:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/echomodel/mcp-app.git
```

### Alternative: FastMCP (manual wiring)

If the user prefers direct control, already has a FastMCP-based
app, or has requirements that mcp-app doesn't cover, use FastMCP
directly with the `mcp` package. The architecture rules (SDK-first,
thin tools, XDG paths) apply equally to both approaches.

**When to suggest FastMCP directly:**
- User explicitly asks for it
- Existing codebase already uses FastMCP and migration isn't wanted
- Need for custom transport or protocol extensions
- stdio-only tool with no deployment plans
- User wants full control over the ASGI middleware stack

## Modes

This skill operates in three modes depending on what the user
needs. Determine the mode from the user's request and the state
of the current working directory.

### Mode 1: Greenfield — Build a New Solution

User wants to create a new MCP server or web API from scratch.

**First, help them decide: local or remote?**

**Local MCP server (stdio)** makes sense when:
- Works with local files, code, git repos, or system config
- Manages the local workstation or development environment
- Needs fast, low-latency interaction
- Single user, single machine

**Remote MCP server (HTTP)** makes sense when:
- Accesses cloud data or external APIs
- Needs to be available from multiple devices
- Needs multi-user support
- Benefits from always-on availability

Based on this, the solution targets stdio only (simpler — no auth,
no deployment) or stdio + HTTP (needs auth, deployment planning).
Both follow the same repo structure.

### Mode 2: Migration — Port an Existing App

1. Check the mcp-app framework version (see below)
2. Read the existing codebase to understand current structure.
   **If deployment config exists** (e.g., `gapp.yaml`,
   Dockerfile, CI config) — do not modify it directly. When
   you reach deployment configuration, invoke the appropriate
   deployment skill if one is available. The runtime contract
   in this skill tells you what the app needs; the deployment
   tool's skill knows how to configure it.
3. **Check for existing auth.** If the app already has
   authentication — custom middleware, a deployment tool's auth
   wrapper, token validation, a user store — migrating to
   mcp-app replaces all of it. Flag this to the user:
   - Existing tokens become invalid after migration
   - Existing users need to be re-registered in mcp-app's
     user store
   - Any stored user credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens)
     need to migrate to mcp-app user profiles
   - MCP clients (Claude.ai, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) will
     need new tokens and possibly updated endpoint URLs
   - Check for existing user data on disk or in cloud storage
     that may need format conversion
4. Walk through the Compliance Checklist, noting conformance
5. Propose a migration plan in priority order
6. Execute with the user's approval
7. Run the checklist again to verify

### Mode 3: Review — Evaluate Against Standards

1. Check the mcp-app framework version (see below)
2. Run the Compliance Checklist and present results as a table
3. For each failure, explain what's wrong and the fix

### Checking the mcp-app framework version

For any existing app that already depends on mcp-app, ensure
the installed version is current before proceeding. Check how
the dependency is declared (e.g., in `pyproject.toml`) and
whether it pins a specific version or commit.

If it points to a git URL with no pin (e.g.,
`mcp-app @ git+https://...`), the installed version may be
stale even though the dependency declaration looks correct.
Reinstall to pull the latest:

```bash
pip install -e . --upgrade
```

After upgrading, if `tests/framework/` exists, run it:

```bash
pytest tests/framework/ -v
```

If it passes, the app is compatible with the new version. If
any tests fail, investigate before proceeding — the failure
may indicate an API change the app needs to adapt to.

If `tests/framework/` does not exist, that's a compliance gap
— adopt the framework test suite (see Step 5 in Testing and
Validation).

If the app pins a specific version or commit, confirm with the
user whether they want to update before making changes that
may depend on newer framework features.

## Repository Structure

### Single-package (recommended for new apps)

```
my-solution/
  my_solution/
    __init__.py       # APP_NAME, mcp_cli, admin_cli, optional Profile
    sdk/
      core.py         # Business logic — ALL behavior here
    mcp/
      tools.py        # Pure async functions calling SDK
    cli/              # Optional — app-specific Click commands
      main.py
  tests/
    unit/
  pyproject.toml
```

### Multi-package (when SDK, MCP, CLI have different dependencies)

Some apps separate SDK, MCP server, and CLI into independent
installable packages so users only install what they need:

```
my-solution/
  sdk/
    my_solution/      # my-solution-sdk package
      __init__.py     # APP_NAME
      core.py
    pyproject.toml
  mcp/
    my_solution_mcp/  # my-solution-mcp package
      __init__.py     # mcp_cli, admin_cli, optional Profile
      tools.py
    pyproject.toml    # depends on my-solution-sdk, mcp-app
  cli/
    my_solution_cli/  # my-solution package (CLI)
      main.py
    pyproject.toml    # depends on my-solution-sdk
  tests/
```

In multi-package repos, the `App` object goes in the MCP package's
`__init__.py` — that's where mcp-app is a dependency.

### __init__.py — the app's identity

**API-proxy app** (needs per-user credentials):

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

class Profile(BaseModel):
    token: str

app = App(
    name="my-solution",
    tools_module=tools,
    profile_model=Profile,
    profile_expand=True,
)
```

**Data-owning app** (no per-user credentials — just identity):

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

app = App(
    name="my-solution",
    tools_module=tools,
)
```

No profile model needed. User identity comes from
`current_user.get().email`. App data lives in the store or
however the app manages its own storage.

### pyproject.toml entry points

```toml
[project]
name = "my-solution"
dependencies = ["mcp-app"]

[project.scripts]
my-solution = "my_solution.cli:cli"           # app's own CLI (optional)
my-solution-mcp = "my_solution:app.mcp_cli"   # serve, stdio
my-solution-admin = "my_solution:app.admin_cli" # connect, users, health

[project.entry-points."mcp_app.apps"]
my-solution = "my_solution:app"
```

One `pipx install my-solution` gives three commands. The
`mcp_app.apps` entry point lets framework tooling discover
the app.

### Rules

- **SDK first.** All behavior lives in the SDK. MCP and CLI are
  thin wrappers.
- **No business logic in MCP tools or CLI commands.**
- **If you're writing logic in a tool or command, stop and move it
  to SDK.**
- **Minimize non-business code.** The goal is to write as little
  code as possible that isn't focused on the problem domain. Use
  mcp-app features when they eliminate boilerplate — that's what
  the framework is for. But don't adopt features the app doesn't
  need. Don't adopt features that don't reduce code, configuration,
  or complexity for this specific app. When existing code handles
  concerns that available tooling already covers — auth, user
  management, server bootstrapping, transport, deployment,
  infrastructure — replace it with the tooling. The goal is to
  shed everything that isn't business logic. If the tooling covers
  most but not all of a concern, work with the user on how to
  close the gap rather than keeping a parallel custom
  implementation.

## MCP Server Setup

### With mcp-app (recommended)

No config files. The `App` object wires everything:

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

app = App(name="my-solution", tools_module=tools)
```

Tools module — plain async functions that call SDK methods:

```python
# my_solution/mcp/tools.py
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK

sdk = MySDK()

async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Do the thing for the current user."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)
```

**Tool discovery:** mcp-app registers all public async functions
in the tools module as MCP tools. Function name → tool name,
docstring → description, type hints → schema. Functions starting
with `_` are skipped.

**Import carefully.** Any async function imported into the tools
module becomes a tool — including SDK functions. Always use a
class-based SDK so tools call `sdk.method()` and SDK methods
stay hidden from discovery.

**SDK has state** (config, file paths, store) — instantiate:
```python
# Data-owning app (e.g., food logger with local storage)
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK
sdk = MySDK()  # holds config, paths

async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Do the thing."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)
```

**SDK is stateless** (just wraps an external API) — use the
class as a namespace via classmethods, no pointless instance:
```python
# API-proxy app (e.g., wraps a financial API)
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK
sdk = MySDK  # the class itself, not an instance

async def list_items() -> dict:
    """List items."""
    return await sdk.list_items()
```

```python
# my_solution/sdk/core.py
class MySDK:
    @classmethod
    def _client(cls):
        user = current_user.get()
        return MyClient(token=user.profile.token)

    @classmethod
    async def list_items(cls) -> dict:
        client = cls._client()
        return await client.get_items()
```

Both patterns prevent leakage. The class groups methods and
keeps client creation in one place.

**Escape hatch for existing function-based SDKs:** if
refactoring to a class isn't worth it, import with underscore
prefix:
```python
from my_solution.sdk import get_items as _get_items
```

Identity middleware runs automatically in HTTP mode. Store
defaults to filesystem. No configuration unless adding custom
middleware.

**Run:**
```bash
my-solution-mcp serve              # HTTP
my-solution-mcp stdio --user local  # stdio
```

### With FastMCP (alternative)

```python
# my_solution/mcp/server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from my_solution import APP_NAME
from my_solution.sdk.core import MySDK

mcp = FastMCP(APP_NAME, stateless_http=True, json_response=True)
mcp.settings.transport_security.enable_dns_rebinding_protection = False

sdk = MySDK()

@mcp.tool()
async def do_thing(param: str) -> dict:
    """Do the thing."""
    return sdk.do_thing(param)

app = mcp.streamable_http_app()  # For uvicorn HTTP mode

def run_server():
    mcp.run()             # For stdio mode
```

## User Identity and Profile

### How it works

In HTTP mode, identity middleware validates the JWT, loads the full
user record from the store (auth + profile in one read), and sets
`current_user` ContextVar. In stdio mode, the CLI loads the user
record from the store using the `--user` flag.

The SDK reads it:

```python
from mcp_app.context import current_user

user = current_user.get()
user.email       # "alice@example.com" (HTTP) or "local" (stdio)
user.profile     # typed Pydantic model or raw dict
```

### Two app patterns — same framework, different SDK reads

**Data-owning** (owns user data — food logs, notes):

```python
from mcp_app.context import current_user
from mcp_app import get_store

class MySDK:
    def save_entry(self, data):
        user = current_user.get()
        store = get_store()
        store.save(user.email, "entries/today", data)
```

The SDK reads `current_user.get().email` for user identity. How
it stores data is the app's choice — `get_store()` provides
mcp-app's per-user key-value store, but the SDK can also manage
its own storage (XDG paths, custom databases, etc.) using the
email as the scoping key.

**API-proxy** (wraps external API — financial data, task management):

```python
from mcp_app.context import current_user
import httpx

class MySDK:
    def list_items(self):
        user = current_user.get()
        token = user.profile.token  # typed via Pydantic
        resp = httpx.get("https://api.example.com/items",
                         headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
        return resp.json()
```

Both use `current_user.get()`. The middleware is the same (identity
only). The SDK decides what to read from the user context.

### Profile registration

The app declares its per-user profile shape:

```python
# my_solution/__init__.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from mcp_app import App
from my_solution.mcp import tools

class Profile(BaseModel):
    token: str

app = App(
    name="my-solution",
    tools_module=tools,
    profile_model=Profile,
    profile_expand=True,
)
```

`profile_expand=True` generates typed CLI flags (`--token`).
`profile_expand=False` accepts the profile as a JSON blob or `@file`.
Profile registration happens automatically when the `App` is
constructed — no separate `register_profile()` call needed.

### User management

**Three CLI entry points per app:**

```bash
# App CLI — the app itself (if it has one)
my-solution do-something

# MCP server
my-solution-mcp serve
my-solution-mcp stdio --user local

# Admin — user management
my-solution-admin connect local
my-solution-admin users add alice --token xxx
my-solution-admin users list
my-solution-admin users revoke alice
my-solution-admin health
```

`connect local` writes to the local filesystem store. `connect <url>`
manages users on a deployed instance via HTTP admin API.

**Generic CLI (no app installed):**

```bash
mcp-app setup https://my-app.run.app --signing-key xxx
mcp-app users add alice --profile '{"token": "xxx"}'
```

Remote only. No typed flags (profile model isn't loaded).

### Environment variables

| Var | Required | If Missing | Purpose |
|-----|----------|------------|---------|
| `SIGNING_KEY` | For HTTP | Startup fails | JWT signing key |
| `JWT_AUD` | No | Audience not validated | Expected JWT `aud` claim |
| `APP_USERS_PATH` | No | `~/.local/share/{name}/users/` | Per-user data directory |
| `TOKEN_DURATION_SECONDS` | No | 315360000 (~10yr) | Token lifetime in seconds |

**`SIGNING_KEY`** — a secret. Never commit it to the repo, never
put it in a checked-in config file. Generate a strong random value:

```bash
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'
```

How the signing key gets into the environment depends on the
deployment tool. Work with the user to determine the right
approach for their setup. Common patterns:

- **CI/CD secrets** — e.g., GitHub Actions secrets injected as
  env vars during deployment
- **Cloud secret managers** — e.g., GCP Secret Manager, AWS
  Secrets Manager, mapped to the env var by the deployment tool
- **Deployment tool generated** — some tools (e.g., Terraform's
  `random_password`) can generate and manage the secret directly

The goal: the secret is stored safely and injected into the
`SIGNING_KEY` env var wherever the server runs. The agent should
guide the user through this for their specific deployment path.

**`JWT_AUD`** — optional. If unset, audience is not validated and
any valid JWT signed with the same key is accepted. If multiple
apps share the same signing key but do not set `JWT_AUD` (or set
it to the same value), they will accept each other's user tokens.
This may be intentional (shared auth across a suite of apps) or
undesirable (cross-app token leakage). If each app has a unique
signing key, audience validation is less critical. Discuss with
the user and let them decide.

**`APP_USERS_PATH`** — critical for any deployment where the
filesystem is not persistent. The default (`~/.local/share/{name}/users/`)
works on a developer's laptop. In a container, this path is
ephemeral — the app starts, users get registered, tools execute,
and then user data is silently lost on container restart. No error,
no warning. For any persistent deployment, this must point to a
mounted volume or persistent storage path. Make the user aware of
this and confirm the path is durable before considering deployment
complete.

**`TOKEN_DURATION_SECONDS`** — defaults to ~10 years, which
effectively means tokens are permanent. If the user wants tokens
to expire sooner, set this. The value applies to newly issued
tokens only — existing tokens keep their original expiry.

## Testing and Validation

After building the solution, write tests and validate both transports.
This is not optional — do it before the compliance dashboard.

### Step 1: SDK unit tests

Test business logic directly. Set `current_user` and env vars
in fixtures — the SDK reads these at runtime:

```python
import os
import pytest
from mcp_app.context import current_user
from mcp_app.models import UserRecord

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def isolated_env(tmp_path):
    os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_DATA"] = str(tmp_path / "data")
    os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_CONFIG"] = str(tmp_path / "config")
    token = current_user.set(UserRecord(email="test-user"))
    yield
    current_user.reset(token)
    del os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_DATA"]
    del os.environ["MY_SOLUTION_CONFIG"]

def test_saves_entry():
    sdk = MySDK()
    result = sdk.save_entry({"item": "apple"})
    assert result["success"]

def test_multi_user_isolation(tmp_path):
    """Data for different users doesn't mix."""
    token = current_user.set(UserRecord(email="alice@example.com"))
    try:
        sdk = MySDK()
        sdk.save_entry({"item": "apple"})
    finally:
        current_user.reset(token)

    token = current_user.set(UserRecord(email="bob@example.com"))
    try:
        sdk = MySDK()
        sdk.save_entry({"item": "banana"})
    finally:
        current_user.reset(token)
```

### Step 2: Full-stack HTTP validation

Validate the entire ASGI stack in-memory using httpx's ASGI
transport. No server process, no port, no Docker. httpx is a
dependency of mcp-app — the solution gets it for free.

**If it works here, it works in uvicorn, it works in Docker.**

```python
import httpx
import jwt as pyjwt
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
from mcp_app.bootstrap import build_app

@pytest.fixture
def app_client(tmp_path):
    os.environ["APP_USERS_PATH"] = str(tmp_path / "users")
    os.environ["SIGNING_KEY"] = "test-key"
    app, mcp, store, config = build_app()
    transport = httpx.ASGITransport(app=app)
    return httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport, base_url="http://test")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_register_and_call_tool(app_client):
    admin_token = pyjwt.encode(
        {"sub": "admin", "scope": "admin",
         "iat": datetime.now(timezone.utc),
         "exp": datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(minutes=5)},
        "test-key", algorithm="HS256",
    )
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {admin_token}"}

    resp = await app_client.post(
        "/admin/users",
        json={"email": "user@example.com",
              "profile": {"token": "test-api-key"}},
        headers=headers,
    )
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    assert "token" in resp.json()
```

### Step 3: stdio validation

```bash
claude mcp add my-solution -- my-solution-mcp stdio --user local
```

### Step 4: Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

All tests must pass before the compliance dashboard.

### Step 5: mcp-app framework test suite

mcp-app ships reusable tests that check auth enforcement,
user admin, JWT handling, CLI wiring, tool protocol compliance,
and SDK test coverage — against YOUR app. These are the
authoritative verification that the app is correctly built on
the framework.

**Check if `tests/framework/` exists.** If it does, run it:

```bash
pytest tests/framework/ -v
```

If it passes, the app is verified. If it fails, investigate —
the failure is either a real compliance issue or an upstream
bug (check mcp-app's issue tracker).

**If `tests/framework/` does not exist, create it now:**

`tests/framework/conftest.py` — the only file that differs
per app (points at your `App` object):

```python
import pytest
from my_solution import app as my_app

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def app():
    return my_app
```

`tests/framework/test_framework.py` — identical across all
mcp-app solutions:

```python
from mcp_app.testing.iam import *
from mcp_app.testing.wiring import *
from mcp_app.testing.tools import *
from mcp_app.testing.health import *
```

Then run:

```bash
pytest tests/framework/ -v
```

Zero failures means: auth works, admin works, tools are wired,
identity is enforced, and the SDK has test coverage for every
tool.

**When to run these tests:**
- After adopting the framework test suite for the first time
- After upgrading mcp-app to a newer version
- After any migration or structural change
- As part of any compliance review

### When to stub

- **Network I/O** — stub HTTP clients, external API calls
- **Cloud CLIs** — mock at the SDK function boundary
- **Everything else** — real code, real files, real config

## Deployment

The solution is a standard Python app. It deploys as a container
or a process on any platform. This section describes what the app
needs from its environment — the runtime contract — and then
covers containerization and deployment routes.

### Running locally

**stdio** — no auth, no signing key. The MCP client launches the
process:
```bash
my-solution-mcp stdio --user local
```

**HTTP** — requires `SIGNING_KEY` at minimum:
```bash
SIGNING_KEY=your-key my-solution-mcp serve
```

With all options:
```bash
SIGNING_KEY=your-key \
APP_USERS_PATH=/data/my-solution/users \
JWT_AUD=my-solution \
TOKEN_DURATION_SECONDS=2592000 \
  my-solution-mcp serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Runtime contract

Any deployment target must provide:

- **Start command:** `my-solution-mcp serve` (optionally
  `--host` and `--port`, defaults to `0.0.0.0:8080`).
  This is a CLI command, not an importable ASGI module path.
  mcp-app does not expose a module-level ASGI app variable —
  it builds the ASGI app internally at startup. Deployment
  tools that distinguish between a raw command and an ASGI
  entrypoint must use the command form.
- **Environment variables:** see the environment variables
  section above — at minimum `SIGNING_KEY` (secret) and
  `APP_USERS_PATH` (persistent path) for any durable deployment
- **Health check:** `GET /health` — no auth required, returns
  `{"status": "ok"}`
- **Auth model:** the app handles its own auth via JWT. If the
  platform has its own auth gate (e.g., IAM, API gateway), it
  must allow unauthenticated traffic through to the app
- **Build root:** the repo root where `pyproject.toml` lives

**Docker example:**
```bash
docker build -t my-solution .
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SIGNING_KEY=your-key \
  -v /persistent/path:/data \
  -e APP_USERS_PATH=/data/users \
  my-solution
```

### Containerizing

If the deployment target needs a container image, add a
Dockerfile to the repo root:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -e .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["my-solution-mcp", "serve"]
```

The build context is the repo root. `pip install -e .` installs
the solution package (which depends on mcp-app). The app listens
on port 8080 by default.

Some deployment tools (e.g., gapp, Cloud Build, Buildpacks)
generate or manage the Dockerfile for you. Check your tool's
documentation before writing one manually.

### Deployment routes

mcp-app does not prescribe a deployment tool. Common options:

- **Bare metal / VPS** — `pip install -e . && my-solution-mcp serve`
  with env vars set in the shell or a process manager
- **Docker** — build the image, run it with `-e SIGNING_KEY=...`
  and a volume mount for `APP_USERS_PATH`
- **Cloud Run / similar** — deploy from source or from a container
  image, set env vars and secrets through the platform
- **gapp** — if you're using the echomodel skill collection,
  there is a deploy skill that handles infrastructure, secrets,
  and data volumes for Cloud Run. Invoke it — it will guide
  through setup, secret configuration, and deployment using
  the runtime contract above.

When using a deployment skill, invoke it now. The runtime
contract, env var requirements, and auth model are already in
your context — map them to the deployment tool's configuration.
After deployment completes, continue below with post-deploy
verification and user management.

Regardless of route, the agent must ensure:
1. `SIGNING_KEY` is sourced from a secrets store or generated by
   the deployment tool — never hardcoded or checked in
2. `APP_USERS_PATH` points to persistent storage — not the
   container's ephemeral filesystem
3. The platform allows unauthenticated HTTP traffic through to
   the app (mcp-app handles auth internally)

### Post-deploy verification

Before verifying, ensure the app's admin CLI is installed and
on PATH. Check with `which my-solution-admin`. If not found,
install the app package that provides the admin entry point
(`pip install -e .` or `pipx install .` from the repo, depending
on the project's layout). Also ensure mcp-app is at the latest
version (see "Checking the mcp-app framework version" above).

After the app is running, verify in order:

**1. Liveness** — confirm the process is up:
```bash
curl https://your-service/health
# {"status": "ok"}
```

**2. Admin auth** — confirm admin JWT works and the store is
connected. Use the signing key to issue an admin token, then
list users:
```bash
my-solution-admin connect https://your-service --signing-key xxx
my-solution-admin users list
```

**3. Register a user** — create the first user and get their
token:
```bash
my-solution-admin users add alice@example.com
# Returns: {"email": "alice@example.com", "token": "..."}
```

For API-proxy apps with a profile model:
```bash
my-solution-admin users add alice@example.com --token api-key-xxx
```

**4. User auth** — confirm user JWT works end-to-end by calling
`tools/list` with the user's token. This goes through the user
JWT middleware (not admin), loads the user record from the store,
and returns the registered tools:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "id": 1}'
```

If this returns the tool list, user auth works, the store loaded
the user record, and tools are wired. The app is fully operational.

### User management

**Three CLI entry points per app:**

```bash
my-solution              # app's own CLI (optional)
my-solution-mcp serve    # HTTP server
my-solution-mcp stdio --user local  # stdio (local, single user)
my-solution-admin        # user management
```

**Managing users (local or remote):**

```bash
# Connect to local store (for stdio apps on this machine)
my-solution-admin connect local

# Connect to a deployed instance
my-solution-admin connect https://your-service --signing-key xxx

# All subsequent commands route automatically
my-solution-admin users add alice@example.com
my-solution-admin users add bob@example.com --token api-key-xxx
my-solution-admin users list
my-solution-admin users revoke alice@example.com
my-solution-admin health  # remote only
```

**Issuing new tokens** (e.g., if a user loses theirs):
```bash
my-solution-admin tokens create alice@example.com
```

The token returned from `users add` or `tokens create` is what
the user puts in their MCP client configuration.

**Generic CLI** (when the app's admin CLI isn't installed locally):
```bash
mcp-app setup https://your-service --signing-key xxx
mcp-app users add alice@example.com --profile '{"token": "xxx"}'
```

### MCP client registration

#### stdio (local)

No signing key needed — stdio has no JWT auth.

**CLI registration:**
```bash
claude mcp add my-solution -- my-solution-mcp stdio --user local
gemini mcp add my-solution -- my-solution-mcp stdio --user local
```

**Manual config** (`~/.claude.json` or `~/.gemini/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-solution": {
      "command": "my-solution-mcp",
      "args": ["stdio", "--user", "local"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### HTTP (remote)

**CLI registration:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http my-solution \
  https://your-service/ \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer USER_TOKEN"
```

**Manual config** (`~/.claude.json` or `~/.gemini/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-solution": {
      "url": "https://your-service/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${MY_SOLUTION_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Both Claude Code and Gemini CLI support `${VAR}` expansion —
reference a host environment variable instead of pasting tokens
into config files.

**Claude.ai / Claude mobile (remote via URL):**
```
https://your-service/?token=USER_TOKEN
```

Remote MCP servers added through Claude.ai are available across
all Claude clients — web, mobile, and Claude Code.

## Compliance Dashboard

After all testing and validation steps are complete (including
the framework test suite from Step 5), present the dashboard:

```
## Solution Compliance Dashboard: {APP_NAME}

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Structure | SDK layer contains all business logic | ✅ |
| Structure | MCP tools are thin wrappers | ✅ |
| MCP | App object declared | ✅ |
| Identity | current_user accessible, profile typed | ✅ |
| CLI | Entry points for mcp + admin | ✅ |
| Testing | SDK unit tests pass | ✅ |
| Testing | mcp-app test suite passes | ✅ |
| Testing | stdio validated | ✅ |
| Deploy | Dockerfile or gapp.yaml present | ❌ |

✅ = conforms  ❌ = missing/wrong  ⚠️ = partial
```

**The solution is ready when `pytest tests/` passes with zero
failures.** The mcp-app test suite is the authoritative check —
if it passes, auth works, admin works, tools are wired, identity
is enforced, and the SDK has test coverage for every tool.

After presenting the dashboard:

1. If there are ❌ or ⚠️ items: "Want me to fix these?"
2. If all ✅: "This solution is ready for deployment."
