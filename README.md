# echoskill

Cross-platform AI agent skills for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/) and [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/). Discover, share, and install reusable capabilities for your AI coding agents.

## Quick Start

Install [`em`](https://github.com/echomodel/echomodel) for skill management across both Claude Code and Gemini CLI:

```bash
pipx install echomodel
em skills marketplace register echoskill https://github.com/echo-skill/echoskill.git
em skills install capture-context
em skills list
```

> **Note:** Claude Code (as of v2.1.89, April 2026) has no native CLI for installing skills from a marketplace. `em` fills this gap, providing the same skill management experience for Claude Code that Gemini CLI offers natively.

### Native Gemini CLI install

Gemini CLI also supports native skill installation without `em`:

```bash
# Install all skills from a collection
gemini skills install https://github.com/echo-skill/echoskill.git --path coding

# Install one skill
gemini skills install https://github.com/echo-skill/echoskill.git --path prompting/nm
```

### Platform targeting

By default, `em` installs into [supported agents](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) (extensible via providers). To install to one platform only:

```bash
em skills install capture-context --target claude
em skills install capture-context --target gemini
```

## How It Works

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: When to invoke this skill
---
Instructions for the agent...
```

Both Claude Code and Gemini CLI discover skills by scanning for `SKILL.md` files. No manifest or registration needed — the file IS the skill.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on adding skills.
